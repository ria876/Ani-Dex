# Description

> The frontend was made in Unity with Android SDK in C#.
>
> Unity is it own IDE. While it supports object-oriented programming, its building blocks are not standard "Objects" but "GameObject" and there "Components".
> I will explain a bit more about this but what is currently in this folder is the custom components I made for the project. For the full Program Unity, has built
> in components that were used as needed.
> 
> # GameObjects
> > A GameObject represents any entity in the project's "game wolrd" (e.g., a character, a tree, a camera, a panel). They can have components attached to them to define their
> > behavour and function.
>
> # Components
> > As said before Components define the behavour of Game Objects (eg: Move on these given inputs, Switch Scenes at this time, Give Rigidbody Physics, etc).
> > Components can be built-in, or custom made. Some basic components are built-in such as Panels, Buttons, Images, Grid Layouts. Custom components
> > have to be programed maniually by the Dev (unually in C#).
